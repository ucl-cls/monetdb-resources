JSON Document structure
=======================

The JSON datatype will hold the metadata currently stored in SIR plus additional information that SIR is not able to handle

JSON provides a flexible structure that can be readily queried to provide additional metadata to supplement the data, for production of instance SPSS files, but also to generate DDI or other metadata for documentation and production processes.

In the longer term the ambition is to align the structure with DDI as it evolves, in particular a JSON flavour of DDI-Views, so that the interfaces require as little coercion as possible
